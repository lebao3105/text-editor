## 'data' branch on textworker
This git branch contains shared application data(s) between both ```main``` and ```wip/wx``` branches:
* Configuration template
* Icons
* GitHub workflows

## Some stuffs for maintainers
If the .Source svg updated but others are not, update it by ```App icon preview```.

Make trans by running builder.py for (lib)textworker - requires gettext

Run github workflows from here.
