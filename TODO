## Welcome to my wxPython port of texteditor (now it's textworker)!

- 1.6:
    - Fully port the app to use libtextworker (it's done)
    - Fix file_operations (come on...)
    - Setup Window on first launch/update (needs some fixes to be done)
    - Side bar & status bar like VSCode (yeah right)
    - Use guesslang to "guess" language of the text
