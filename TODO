## Welcome to my wxPython port of texteditor (now it's textworker)!

    # Add fixes and implement missing features in older Tkinter versions.
    - Building:

        * (Pack) use py2exe.freeze (Cancelled - use pyinstaller instead)
    - Toplevel folder (textworker)
        * (Tabs) finish what it needs
        * (Mainwindow) finish folder view (skipped)
    - textworker.backend
