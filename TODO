## Welcome to my wxPython port of texteditor (now it's textworker)!

- 1.6:
    # Add fixes and implement missing features in older Tkinter versions.
    - Building:
        * (Meson) install icons in a better way
        * (Pack) use py2exe.freeze
        * (Pack) maybe use AppImage again?
    - Toplevel folder (textworker)
        * (Tabs) finish what it needs
        * (Mainwindow) finish folder view
    - textworker.backend
        * (File_operations) implement file comparison and fix function names
        * (Get_config) autocolor
    - textworker.extensions
        * Move autosave & cmd to use wxPython.
