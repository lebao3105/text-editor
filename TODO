## Welcome to my wxPython port of texteditor (now it's textworker)!

- 1.6:
    - Fully port the app to use libtextworker (it's done)
    - Fix file_operations (done!)
    - ~~Setup Window on first launch/update (needs some fixes to be done)~~
    - Side bar & status bar like VSCode (yeah right) (can't make statusbar)
    - Use guesslang to "guess" language of the text (cancelled)
    - Settings window (this is hard)
- 1.7:
    - File backup (ends with ~ or .bck)
    - Consider using wxFlatNotebook for more customized tab-zone, but we'll lost tabs dragging
    - Learn how to send inputs to subprocess.Popen
    - Make FirstRunDialog great (again)
    - Further we can make extensions support

Side requests:
- Dependency management
- Logging fix (libtew side)
- Translations
