## Welcome to my wxPython port of texteditor (now it's textworker)!

- 1.6:
    # Add fixes and implement missing features in older Tkinter versions.
    - Building:
        * (Meson) install icons in a better way
        * (Pack) use py2exe.freeze
    - Toplevel folder (textworker)
        * (Tabs) finish what it needs
        * (Mainwindow) finish folder view (skipped)
    - textworker.backend
        * (File_operations) implement file comparison (not ready yet) and fix function names (completed)
        * (Get_config) autocolor (completed)
    - textworker.extensions
        * Move autosave & cmd to use wxPython.
